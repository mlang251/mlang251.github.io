		<h2>About</h2>

		<p>I have been learning web development since August of 2016, teaching myself and learning all that I can from various online resources and textbooks. So far I have been practicing by recreating existing webpages from scratch, which has been an incredible learning experience because it forces me to learn common practices used in professional website coding.</p>

		<p>I am currently in my senior year at Northeastern University in Boston, MA, and will be graduating in May with a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering. In school I acquired many technical skills relating to both electrical hardware and software, as well as problem solving skills such as troubleshooting and critical thinking. Many of these skills apply not only to engineering, but also to a wide range of field and careers.</p>

		<p>Over the past year, I have been considering what sort of career I want to commit to. After the rigorous and strictly defined coursework I completed in engineering school, I felt I wanted a career that would allow for more artistic creativity and freedom</p>

		<p><span>[This is where web development comes in]</span></p>

		<p>I see web development as a perfect combination of the skills I learned throughout my coursework and the artistic mode of thinking which I exhibit in many facets of my life. A job in web development will bring me satisfaction and a welcome challenge. </p>

		<h3>Aside from school and web development, other important aspects of my life include, but are not limited to:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>People &amp; communication</li>
			<li>Music (I play guitar, piano, and I sing. I also write, record, and produce my own music)</li>
			<li>Photography (I shoot 35mm film)</li>
			<li>Moments of hilarity</li>
			<li>Challenging myself to break from comfort zones</li>
		</ul>
		</ul>

		<h2>Goals</h2>

		<p>My main goal is to graduate from college in May and begin a career in web development by working with a small group of developers and creative designers to learn from and bounce ideas off of. So far my area of focus in web development has been front end static sites, but I have interest in learning full stack development, as well as how to make web and mobile apps.</p>
		
		<h3>Some of the languages and tools I know are:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>HTML5</li>
			<li>CSS3</li>
			<li>Javascript</li>
			<li>jQuery 3.1.1</li>
			<li>Git</li>
			<li>Python</li>
			<li>C++</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>And I have an interest in learning:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>AngularJS</li>
			<li>Django</li>
			<li>Server side programming</li>
			<li>Android and IOS programming</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Experience</h2>

		<p>My knowledge of programming began in college, where I took courses in C++. I was attracted to the process of creating a program, from defining the scope, to finding creative ways to work around a problem, and I then taught myself Python as well as all the other web development tools mentioned above. The most valuable, most appicable lesson I learned in school was that if something doesn't come easy at first, then it will be all the more rewarding when you achieve your goal, but it takes a hard work ethic and dedication, which are traits that I pride myself in having.</p>
