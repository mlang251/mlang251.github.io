                        , and will be graduating in May with a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering. In school I acquired many technical skills, relating to both electrical hardware and software, as well as problem solving skills such as troubleshooting and critical thinking. Many of these skills apply not only to engineering, but also to a wide range of fields and careers.</p>

                        <p>Over the past year, I have been considering what sort of career I want to commit to. After the rigorous and strictly defined coursework I completed in engineering school, I felt I wanted a career that would allow for more artistic creativity and freedom.</p>

The UI is built with React and the server is built in Node on an Express framework. The server controls the flow of data between multiple client applications (using socket.io and UDP sockets), while the UI is responsible for rendering an intuitive experience for the user to build audio effects chains</p>

This was my first web app, and I did a lot of research on the parent-child component rendering relationship, state management, component lifecycle, and component organization. I chose to use React because it is gaining tons of traction and popularity, and because there are plenty of resources for learning React. Some of the top skills I learned in the making of this app were state management, separating container and presentational components, creating reusable components, and organizing my code so that it is readable and understandable by anyone.</p>

The keyboard-navigability was done using object-oriented Javascript, and had a huge impact on the way people with disabilities can browse my website.

                                <p>This project fulfilled two goals of mine: To create a simple way to initialize React projects, and to learn about batch scripting in Windows. To do this, I followed the article, <a href = "https://www.codecademy.com/articles/react-setup-i">React Setup</a>, published by Codecademy.com, to get a step by step guide on what to download, which commands to run, and which files need to be created in order to initalize a React project. I then learned about batch scripting and created a .bat file which automates the entire process. Initializing React projects is now as easy as typing in a single script call to the command line</p>
                                <p>Fun fact: I created this batch script before I knew <a href = "https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app">Create React App</a> existed.</p>
