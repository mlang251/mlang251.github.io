					<p>I have been learning web development since August of 2016, teaching myself and learning all that I can from various online resources and textbooks. So far I have been practicing by recreating existing webpages from scratch, which has been an incredible learning experience because it forces me to learn common practices used in professional website coding.</p>

					<p>I am currently in my senior year at Northeastern University in Boston, MA, and will be graduating in May with a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering. In school I acquired many technical skills relating to both electrical hardware and software, as well as problem solving skills such as troubleshooting and critical thinking. Many of these skills apply not only to engineering, but also to a wide range of field and careers.</p>

					<p>Over the past year, I have been considering what sort of career I want to commit to. After the rigorous and strictly defined coursework I completed in engineering school, I felt I wanted a career that would allow for more artistic creativity and freedom</p>

						<!--This paragraph appears to the right side so that it reads like an inner thought-->
						<p class = "col-sm-offset-8 col-sm-4"><span>[This is where web development comes in]</span></p>
					</div>

					<p>I see web development as a perfect combination of the skills I learned throughout my coursework and the artistic mode of thinking which I exhibit in many facets of my life. A job in web development will bring me satisfaction and a welcome challenge.</p>

			<div class = "row">
				<p class = "col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-10">My knowledge of programming began in college, where I took courses in C++. I was attracted to the process of creating a program, from defining the scope, to finding creative ways to work around a problem, and I then taught myself Python as well as all the other web development tools mentioned above. The most valuable, most applicable lesson I learned in school was that if something doesn't come easy at first, then it will be all the more rewarding when you achieve your goal, but it can only be achieved with a hard work ethic and dedication, which are traits that I pride myself in having.</p>
