					<p>I have been learning web development since August of 2016, teaching myself and learning all that I can from various online resources and textbooks. So far I have been practicing by recreating existing webpages from scratch, which has been an incredible learning experience because it forces me to learn common practices used in professional website coding.</p>

					, and will be graduating in May with a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering. In school I acquired many technical skills, relating to both electrical hardware and software, as well as problem solving skills such as troubleshooting and critical thinking. Many of these skills apply not only to engineering, but also to a wide range of fields and careers.</p>

					<p>Over the past year, I have been considering what sort of career I want to commit to. After the rigorous and strictly defined coursework I completed in engineering school, I felt I wanted a career that would allow for more artistic creativity and freedom.</p>

					<p>I see web development as a perfect combination of the skills I learned throughout my coursework and the artistic mode of thinking which I exhibit in many facets of my life. A job in web development will bring me satisfaction and a welcome challenge.</p>

					<h2>Projects</h2>
					<p>My knowledge of programming began in college, where I took courses in C++. I was attracted to the process of creating a program, from defining the scope, to finding creative ways to work around a problem, and I then taught myself Python as well as all the other web development tools mentioned above. The most valuable, most applicable lesson I learned in school was that if something doesn't come easy at first, then it will be all the more rewarding when you achieve your goal, but it can only be achieved with a hard work ethic and dedication, which are traits that I pride myself in having.</p>

							<h3>Tab-navigable accessibility</h4>
							<p><span>Purpose</span> To provide a fully accessible site that is simple and easy to navigate</p>
						</header>
						<p>I wanted to learn how to make my website more accessible to users with disabilities, so I researched accessibility in the <a href = "https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-wai-aria-20140320/"</p>W3C specification for Accessible Rich Internet Applications</a>, and outfitted my website with <abbr title = "Accessible Rich Internet Applications">ARIA</abbr> roles, properties, and labels. I also ensured that my website was fully navigable using the keyboard, as outlined in the article, <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Keyboard-navigable_JavaScript_widgets">Keyboard-navigable Javascript Widgets</a>, published by the Mozilla Development Network. The keyboard-navigability was done using object-oriented Javascript, and had a huge impact on the way people with disabilities can browse my website. Using the tab, arrow, and enter/space keys ensures that people with visual or motor impairements can navigate my webite easily and fluidly.</p>

							<h3>Batch script for initializing ReactJS projects</h4>
							<p><span>Purpose</span> To create a simple way to run the <abbr title = "Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr> for the beginning steps of making a project in React</p>
						</header>
						<p>This project fulfilled two goals of mine: To create a simple way to initialize React projects, and to learn about batch scripting in Windows. To do this, I followed the article, <a href = "https://www.codecademy.com/articles/react-setup-i">React Setup</a>, published by Codecademy.com, to get a step by step guide on what to download, which commands to run, and which files need to be created in order to initalize a React project. I then learned about batch scripting and created a .bat file which automates the entire process. Initializing React projects is now as easy as typing in a single script call to the command line</p>
